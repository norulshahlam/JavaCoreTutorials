The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer parent class objects.  The keyword “super” came into the picture with the concept of Inheritance. 

If a constructor does not explicitly invoke a superclass constructor, the Java compiler automatically inserts a call to the no-argument constructor of the superclass.
