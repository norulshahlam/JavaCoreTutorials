1. thread using structured approach
2. thread using functional approach

  You can see that we can get rid of all the ceremony round creating a runnable interface, defining a method, and all that stuff. All that we need to do is, to create runnable is equal to, just define a simple lambda expression. What would happen is, this would create a implementation of the runnable interface. Why is it creating the implementation of the runnable interface?

  Because runnable is also a functional interface. There is just one abstract method which is present in here: run()
